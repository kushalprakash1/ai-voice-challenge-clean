# Real-audio findings: latest failed call at Flux EOT 0.85

The stored inbound track for call `example-call-002`
was replayed through Deepgram Flux at native 8 kHz, mono, linear16 with
`eot_threshold=0.85`.

The replay exposed four deterministic-policy gaps that transcript-only tests
had not covered. First, Flux can combine the recording disclaimer and the first
actionable profile request into one EndOfTurn, so actionable requests must
outrank a boilerplate prefix. Second, a short acknowledgement such as
`Great, Alex.` is non-actionable and should be WAIT rather than FALLBACK.
Third, `routine checkup` is appointment-type language. Fourth, a Flux turn
ending on a function word such as `for` is syntactically incomplete and should
HOLD rather than enter fallback.

The replay also rendered the authoritative DOB as
`April twelfth nineteen ninety eight`; flow-state confirmation now accepts that
spoken-number form.

This historical recording is open-loop evidence. It is appropriate for testing
ASR boundaries, routing, response correctness, and state evidence, but not for
proving that a counterfactual v3 live conversation would follow the same later
path.

The exact 13 Flux EndOfTurn transcripts are frozen in
`tests/fixtures/v3_calls/flux_latest_eot_085.jsonl`.

## Real WorkerRunner latest-call provider wording

The real Pipecat WorkerRunner replay surfaced a second provider-choice wording:
the remote agent named two doctors and asked whether the patient had a
preference or whether it should offer the first available. This is semantically
the same provider-preference primitive as the previously observed
"first available okay?" wording.

The fast policy now recognizes provider-choice turns structurally when they
mention first available, identify a provider/doctor/physician option, and ask
for a preference/choice. No provider names are encoded.

## Concrete-slot completion gate

The historical recordings end before an actual appointment slot is accepted
and confirmed, so replay success alone cannot prove the final booking stage.
Before Asterisk integration, Autonomous Patient Agent v3 now treats a concrete compatible PM
slot offer as an explicit booking action: it responds with a booking instruction
and stores the exact offered time in structured flow state. Explicit non-Friday
offers are declined.

A later remote statement that the concrete slot is booked, scheduled, confirmed,
or reserved is non-actionable speech (WAIT) but confirms the SLOT and
CONFIRMATION stages. Only that explicit remote confirmation makes the flow
complete. This gives the Asterisk adapter an evidence-backed success signal.
